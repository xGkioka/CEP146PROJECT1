* Generative AI nowadays have been a mainstream with software developers.
* According to a recent survey from Github, more than one million developers have been using Github copilot.
* A lot of developers have been using AI and they treat this platform as a new building block for software development.
*With AI generating all over the Tech Industry there are still some people who doesn't benefit from Generative AI.
### Key Points
1. Developers Want AI Tools
* Everyone want to use different AI Code Assistant when it comes to different types of coding or programming
2. AI Boosts Productivity
* With the use of AI Code Assistant it helps developers to code faster and easier.
* Developers are more likely to use GIthub as their platform when it comes to coding.
3. Difference between Senior and Junior developer
* Senior - For senior developers using AI code assistant is a big help since they know the basic on how the program or software works and AI will just like be an assistant for them to walkthrough the software.
* Junior - For junior developer they could struggle in the middle of the software developments since they won't be aware if AI codes are wrong or efficient.
4. AI Isn’t a Replacement for Expertise
* For people who have been long in the industry, they wont be needing AI to make the program for them but they will use AI as a guidance for them to start.
Having a good experience and not relying on AI is also good since it will hone your skill in determining the errors/mistakes you have in a certain program.
5. Metaphor: Treat AI Like an Intern
* AI is compared to a “very eager junior developer”—fast, helpful, but we cannot assure that it will always give the correct answers from our questions.
6.Potential Trap for Beginners
* If you are a beginner and you rely just on AI assistant it will burden you in the long run.
Without the help from the expertise they will find hard time the correct there mistakes and will end up in a cycle of errors.


## AI coding assistants aren’t really making devs feel more productive

## Key Points
1.Productivity survey
* As of now only 6% of lead engineers have seen significant productivity.
* There has not been a shortage when it comes to coding tasks and this had become a big impact when it comes to their productivity
2. Perceived Productivity Gains
* GitHub: 88% of Copilot users feel more productive when they are using coding assistants. Because with the help of AI they can easily determine and analyze the program/software they are developing.

Notes
Since the launch of ChatGPT, AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor have become common in developers’ workflows, assisting with tasks such as code generation and refactoring. However, despite the hype, most engineering leaders report only small productivity gains of 1–10%. Experts note that AI tools often focus too narrowly on writing code while ignoring deeper issues like testing delays and team communication. Real productivity improvements, they argue, will only come when developers are directly involved in identifying problems and shaping how AI tools are used.

### Good things about AI Coding Assistant
1. Helpful pair programmer
Using AI feels like you have a partner when programming. It helps you in a way that you can collaborate the ideas, problems, suggestions and can catch potential issues before they become bugs.
2. Great at automating away toil and repetitive task
AI helps in a way that it can help your task to be managed in an organize way. Like it can do a simple find and replace task. Just to make sure that you are on the right path you still need to double check everything but AI can generally lessen the work hours that you do.
3. Great for prototyping and experimenting with unfamiliar languages
AI can help you when it comes to unfamiliar languages since they can show you some codes that you haven't encounter yet but you can always learn on every codes that AI will be prompting.
Also it can be a big help if you are doing a new project since you can collaborate with AI for your prototype and it will challenge you to learn more about a certain language.
### Annoying part
1. It can get stuck in an endless loop of incorrect suggestions
Although AI is helpful sometimes it can give you a wrong ideas which if you don't double check you might end up in an endless loop of problems.
### The Surprising Parts
1. It makes mistakes, but knows it too
* Even if AI Coding Assistants are programmed to give you answers they make mistakes too. If you are a senior developer you would notice if there are mistakes on what AI answers are giving. Be careful in every answer it gives. Also if AI made mistakes it can fix that problem by itself.
2. It doesn’t question you and takes (most of) your suggestions seriously, even when it was right
* I have notice that whenever I use AI even if the answer is correct it will still give you prompts which has an error but it will also give you how the process is right.
