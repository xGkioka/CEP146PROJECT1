# CEP146 – Group Project: Software Development Current Event

**Topic (working):**  Not decided yet
**Team:** Xenofon Gkioka, Antonio Oscar Hocbo, Rasel Ahmmed, Aida Aghaei,  Sapphire Grant 
**Presentation date:** 17 oct 2025

## TL;DR (10 seconds)
- What happened: [one sentence with date + who did it]
- Why it matters: [1 line on impact to developers]
- What we recommend: [3 action verbs: “Upgrade X / Learn Y / Avoid Z”]


## Roles & Deliverables
- **Lead / Event Scout (Xenofon Gkioka):** define scope, write `research/event-summary.md`
- **Analyst / Data (Antonio Oscar Hocbo):** pull numbers/charts, write `research/impact.md`
- **Dev Translator (Rasel Ahmmed):** write actionable “for developers” list in `script/dev-impact.md`
- **Designer (Sapphire Grant ):** build slides in `/slides`, check visuals & branding
- **Coordinator (Aida Aghaei):** keeps deadlines, merges PRs, final README polish & upload slides

## Workflow
1. Each person works in a branch: `feat/<name>-<part>`.
2. Commit small, clear messages (`data: add adoption stats + sources`).
3. Open PRs and request 1 review before merge.
4. Keep `main` always ready to present.

## Slide Flow
1. Title (event + date + org)
2. What happened
3. Why it matters
4. Evidence (chart/number w/ citation)
5. For developers (Do now)
6. Citations

## Deliverable Checklist
- [ ] Topic dated 2024–2025
- [ ] 3–5 credible sources in `research/sources.md`
- [ ] At least one chart/metric w/ on-slide citation
- [ ] Speaker notes (`/script/*.md`) 60–90s each
- [ ] Final deck exported to `/slides/final.pdf`

## Citation Format
- **Title** — Publisher (Date). URL  
  *Used for: [slide / stat]*

## Common Pitfalls
- Picking timeless topic (no event/date)
- Missing on-slide citations
- Slides full of text (keep ≤4 bullets, ≤8 words each)
